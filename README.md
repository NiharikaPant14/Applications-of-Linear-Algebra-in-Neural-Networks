# 🧠 Applications of Linear Algebra in Neural Networks

🚧 *Currently in development! Contributions, ideas, and discussions are welcome.* 🚧

Welcome to the playground where math meets intelligence!  
This project **visualizes** the deep linear algebra happening inside a **customizable neural network** — step-by-step — to make it intuitive, explorable, and hackable.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Most treat neural networks as mysterious black boxes.  
But **behind every prediction lies beautiful linear algebra** — matrices, vectors, and transformations.  
This project demystifies neural networks by **visualizing the linear algebra** happening at each stage: input layer, hidden layers, output layer, loss calculation, and backpropagation.

✨ **Why is this valuable?**
- Easier learning for students and beginners.
- mathematical debugging for ML enthusiasts.
- Faster debugging and model improvements.

## ✨ Solution Overview

- Build a **neural network from scratch** using only basic Python and math.
- **Visualize** the internal linear algebra computations at every step.
- Allow **live customization**:
  - Change loss functions 🔥
  - Modify activation functions ⚡
  - Update optimizers 🛠️
  - Instantly see the effects on the model and math!
